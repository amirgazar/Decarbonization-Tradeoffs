# Cost uncertainties and ecological impacts drive tradeoffs  
# between electrical system decarbonization pathways in New England, U.S.A.

## Abstract
This repository contains all code, data and figures to reproduce the analysis of cost uncertainties and ecological impacts in electrical‐system decarbonization pathways for New England. We develop:
- a stochastic power‐plant model  
- decarbonization pathway scenarios  
- a generation expansion model  
- total cost and ecological‐impact assessments under uncertainty
